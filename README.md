# Sid's Personal Blog

A personal blog built with `Next.js`, `MDX`, and `Typescript`, and deployed with `Vercel`.

Blog starter forked from [next-js-mdx-blog](https://github.com/ChangoMan/nextjs-typescript-mdx-blog). Also drew heavy inspiration from my good friend Ketan Agrawal's [blog](https://ketan.me).

## Structure:

All blog post content (besides About page, etc.) is stored under the `/posts` directory. Feel free to use this repo as a starter for your own blog. 

If developing, run `yarn install` to install the relevant dependencies, and run `yarn dev` to build a development version of the site.
